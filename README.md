##Epic 

Question/answer websites are made available to those who require assistance when running into 
roadblocks that may halt progress.  These sites are fantastic as they serve as forums that people can 
use to move forward with projects, classwork and assignments in a timely manner.  Although these sites are 
great, anyone who has a question may access the content as long as they create a profile.  Because anyone 
can create a profile on the site, questions may have multiple answers, no matter the accuracy.  In an attempt 
to allow users the ability to quickly identify the most accurate answers to questions, we would like to add 
functionality to the site which would allow the question asker to vote up or down on an answer.  This feature 
would allow for identification of the most useful or accurate answer for others who may have the same or a similar
question.  A feature such as this would result in users finding what they need more quickly and efficiently, as well as
site cleanliness and improved functionality.  Those answers that receive multiple down votes will be removed from the
website resulting in the improved site speed and usability mentioned above.  This enhancement will add to an already 
useful and appreciated application.
